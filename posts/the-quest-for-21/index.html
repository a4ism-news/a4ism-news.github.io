<p>Despite the numerous records set by the ‘Big 3,’ the topic of who is the ‘Greatest Of All Time’ (GOAT) is still quite a contentious one. Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic have all cemented themselves as the three most celebrated and decorated tennis players in the history of the men’s game. Having all reached the almost inconceivable pinnacle of Grand Slam (formally referred to as ‘majors’) tennis with 20 singles trophies each, the search for who is the greatest among them continues into 2022. This is not to say however, that grand slams are the only indicators of who would be considered the GOAT in collectives minds of tennis fans the world over, as popularity plays perhaps the largest role in the almost benign title.</p>
<p>It is clear that, having been named the ATPtour.com fan’s favourite a record 18 times (out of a possible 21), Roger Federer leads the race in that regard. Boasting the second longest stint at the top of the ATP rankings (second only to Novak Djokovic, who is the reigning number 1 as at the publishing of this article), and the longest consecutive streak as the men’s best player (237 weeks), it is no surprise that the loudest voices in the tennis community would dub Roger Federer as the GOAT.</p>
<p>Rafael Nadal however, has two titles bestowed upon him, with one being irrefutable: ‘The undisputed king of clay,” having won a record 13 Rolland Garros titles, and a record 62 titles on the surface overall. Though his clay court achievements have at times squeezed him into a limited ‘clay court specialist’ box, his grand slam results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic on the other hand, is in this company based purely on his amazing results. Objectively the least popular of the Big 3, he has not only matched the other two tennis giants, but he has matched and surpassed them in many categories; number of masters titles (tied with Nadal at 36), number of Grand Slam titles (all three are tied with 20), weeks at number 1 (342 as at the publishing of this article), number of Grand Slam titles won in a row (4), has secured the trophy at each grand slam trophy at least twice, has won all masters singles trophies twice (no other player has achieved it even once). If one has immersed themselves in the world of tennis fandom, then it comes as no surprise that Novak Djokovic has the most work to do when it comes to securing popularity. Having done himself no favours in this regard, with his Adria Tour of 2020 being held in Serbia and Croatia during a rather tumultuous time during the COVID-19 pandemic, his support for a violent retaking of Kosovo by Serbia in 2008, and his numerous appearances with perpetrators and deniers of Bosnian genocide during the early 1990s (current incumbent presidential cabinet member of Bosnia, Milorad Dodik and Milan Jolovic in particular).</p>
<p>Despite this rampant and often vitriolic popularity contest, the numbers speak for themselves, and whomever holds the most Grand Slam trophies will have earned the title of GOAT.</p>
